MasterMind is the first board game program of mild or moderate complexity that I developed as a self-taught programmer. I first implemented it in C++ using Visual C++ 6.0 on MS-Windows XP with it's Document-View Architecture of its MFC Library & Visual Form tools for the user interface and interactivity & then I adapted some codes from that implementation when I self-taught myself to program in Java using only gedit editor & Java SDK version 1.8.0_262 on Linux Centos 7.
