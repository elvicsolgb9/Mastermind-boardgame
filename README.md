# Mastermind-boardgame
A program the plays the Mastermind board game (Break the hidden code).

This program is by no means complete. I just uploaded to share it to anyone who would like to take a look at it and provide some improvements. 
Or if someone would like to take a look on the algorithm on how to evaluate the breaker color against the hidden color and add it to their project,
whether that be a school project or what not you're free to utilize it. I would appreciate if you can give an attribution but is unnecessary.

Please read the 'Developer's Note' for a little more info about this program.
